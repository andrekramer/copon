'll write a programming manual for Cop-on, the context-oriented programming language described in your document. I'll focus on creating syntax that expresses the semantic concepts while making it applicable to AI workflows.

I've created a comprehensive programming manual for Cop-on, a context-oriented programming language based on your specifications. The manual covers:

Introduction to context-oriented programming - Explaining the core principles and benefits of making context a first-class concept
Language fundamentals - Basic syntax and structure with examples
Context management - How to define, combine, and work with typed contexts
Functions with context - How functions receive, transform, and return contexts
Type system - Rules for context types, including the single-type-per-context rule and type inference
Concurrency model - Using context checkpointing and spawning for safe parallel execution
Error handling - Explicit error handling through result types rather than context mutation
Testing and verification - Using mock contexts and assertions for comprehensive testing
AI integration - How to use contexts to manage AI workflows, collaboration between models, and safety checks
Standard library - Common context types for IO, databases, and networking
Best practices - Guidelines for effective context-oriented programming

The syntax I've developed incorporates all the key concepts from your specification while maintaining readability. The manual illustrates how Cop-on combines functional, procedural, and object-oriented paradigms through explicit context handling.
Would you like me to expand on any particular section of the manual or provide additional examples of how Cop-on would be used in specific scenarios?
