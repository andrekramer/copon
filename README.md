AI generated summary:
Context Oriented Programming (COP) unifies the strengths of functional, procedural, and object oriented paradigms by making dependencies and mutable state explicit through a typed context. This design not only simplifies dependency management and testing but also enables robust concurrency, safe checkpointing, and efficient orchestration of AI workflowsâ€”all by treating the context as the central carrier of state and environment.
